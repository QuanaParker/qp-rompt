            <h2>Hey folks! üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
            <p>


So, I've been tinkering with this side project called Qp-Rompt. It's a playground for AI prompts, and I thought, why not share it with you all?<br>
<br>
What's the vibe?<br>
<br>
    <li>Got an AI tool? We've got prompts! Everything from "code-challenges" to "just-for-laughs".</li>
    <li>Toss in your own prompts, see the cool stuff others come up with.</li>
    <li>It's all experimental right now. Think of it as a sandbox for AI enthusiasts.</li>
    <li>Super early days, so there might be some rough edges. Bear with me! üòâ</li>
    <br>
If you've got some time, give it a whirl, play around, and let me know what you think. Would be cool to see where we can take this together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Project Overview:<br>
A dynamic web platform designed to serve as a repository for prompts, facilitating discussions and interactions around them. It showcases the creator's proficiency in modern web development technologies, best practices, and database management.<br>
<br>
